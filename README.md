## Good plan practises

A “ready” backlog item needs to be clear, feasible and testable.

A user story is clear if all Scrum team members have a shared understanding of what it means. Collaboratively writing user stories, and adding acceptance criteria to the high-priority ones facilitates clarity.

An item is testable if there is an effective way to determine if the functionality works as expected. Acceptance criteria ensure that each story can be tested.

A user story is feasible if it can be completed in one sprint, according to the Definition of Done. If this is not achievable, it needs be broken down further.

Essentially the Definition of Done are the agreed upon acceptance criteria that the Product Owner will use to accept the product increment at the end of the sprint.
